# Why I’m a Great Fit for the Synopsys R\&D Engineering Internship

Hello! I’m **Naresh Lankalapalli**, a final-year **B.Tech (ECE) student at RGUKT Srikakulam** with a strong foundation in **digital design, computer architecture, and hardware–software co-design**.
My passion lies in **building from the ground up** — whether it’s designing a MIPS32 5-stage pipelined processor in Verilog, optimizing CNN inference on an FPGA, or deploying AI workloads on edge devices.

## 🎯 Why Me?

* **Solid Computer Architecture Experience** – Designed and verified a **MIPS32 5-stage pipelined processor** supporting R-, I-, and J-type instructions, applying hazard handling and pipeline optimization concepts directly from theory into working hardware.
* **Hands-On RTL Design Skills** – Comfortable with **Verilog/SystemVerilog** for both design and verification, during my Maven Silicon internship.
* **FPGA & HLS Expertise** – Built custom accelerators using **Vivado HLS** for AI workloads, integrating with Zynq MPSoCs (KV260) and deploying **DPU-based real-time inference pipelines**.
* **Linux & Toolchain Proficiency** – Experienced in working with **Xilinx Vivado, PYNQ, Vitis HLS, and Synopsys tools**, with strong Git/Linux workflow.
* **End-to-End System Development** – Skilled at moving from **algorithm → RTL/HLS design → FPGA prototyping → real-time deployment**, making me comfortable in both hardware and software aspects.
